steeps
1. find all matches
2. minimize epitome charts
3. create epitome atlas

TODO:
- use alternative image and reconstruction base
- use epitome atlas for reconstruction
- color/orient histogram bad match selection
- epitome grow process
- more and excluded debug vis. (interface)
- asserts/exceptions

DONE:
- save epitome atlas data
- better orientation histograms
- correct color scaling for shared matches
- speedup steep one (some opencv profiling needed)
- start steep two
- move calc. to thread (sort of)
- use opencv2 c++ binding instead of c binding
- vis. all matches
- serialize/save matches
