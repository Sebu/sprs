abstract = {We propose in this paper to unify two different approaches to image restoration: On the one hand, learning a basis set (dictionary) adapted to sparse signal descriptions has proven to be very effective in image reconstruction and classification tasks. On the other hand, explicitly exploiting the self-similarities of natural images has led to the successful non-local means approach to image restoration. We propose simultaneous sparse coding as a framework for combining these two approaches in a natural manner. This is achieved by jointly decomposing groups of similar signals on subsets of the learned dictionary. Experimental results in image denoising and demosaicking tasks with synthetic and real noise show that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art, making it possible to effectively restore raw images from digital cameras at a reasonable speed and memory cost.},

abstract = {The use of sparse representations in signal processing is gradually increasing in the past several years. In a previous work we proposed a new method for compressing facial images using the K-SVD algorithm, which is a novel algorithm for training overcomplete dictionaries that lead to sparse signal representations. This method was shown to be most efficient, surpassing the JPEG2000 performance significantly. In this paper we present a significant addition to our compression algorithm in the form of image deblocking. Since the encoding is done in patches, a visually disturbing artifacts of blockiness appear in the reconstructed images. We eliminate these artifacts using a linear deblocking technique, which is based on local image filters. We construct a linear filter for each relevant pixel independently, and apply these filters as post-processing. This method is limited, but nevertheless it improves the PSNR of the reconstructed images and gives visually appealing results.},

abstract = {The spatial receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian striate cortex have been reasonably well described physiologically and can be characterized as being localized, oriented, and bandpass, comparable with the basis functions of wavelet transforms. Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete-i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

abstract = {This paper presents a generative model for textures that uses a local sparse description of the image content. This model enforces the sparsity of the expansion of local texture patches on adapted atomic elements. The analysis of a given texture within this framework performs the sparse coding of all the patches of the texture into the dictionary of atoms. Conversely, the synthesis of a new texture is performed by solving an optimization problem that seeks for a texture whose patches are sparse in the dictionary. This paper explores several strategies to choose this dictionary. A set of hand crafted dictionaries composed of edges, oscillations, lines or crossings elements allows to synthesize synthetic images with geometric features. Another option is to define the dictionary as the set of all the patches of an input exemplar. This leads to computer graphics methods for synthesis and shares some similarities with non-local means filtering. The last method we explore learns the dictionary by an optimization process that maximizes the sparsity of a set of exemplar patches. Applications of all these methods to texture synthesis, inpainting and classification shows the efficiency of the proposed texture model.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to single-image super-resolution, based on sparse signal representation. Research on image statistics suggests that image patches can be well-represented as a sparse linear combination of elements from an appropriately chosen over-complete dictionary. Inspired by this observation, we seek a sparse representation for each patch of the low-resolution input, and then use the coefficients of this representation to generate the high-resolution output. Theoretical results from compressed sensing suggest that under mild conditions, the sparse representation can be correctly recovered from the downsampled signals. By jointly training two dictionaries for the low- and high-resolution image patches, we can enforce the similarity of sparse representations between the low resolution and high resolution image patch pair with respect to their own dictionaries. Therefore, the sparse representation of a low resolution image patch can be applied with the high resolution image patch dictionary to generate a high resolution image patch. The learned dictionary pair is a more compact representation of the patch pairs, compared to previous approaches, which simply sample a large amount of image patch pairs 1, reducing the computational cost substantially. The effectiveness of such a sparsity prior is demonstrated for both general image super-resolution and the special case of face hallucination. In both cases, our algorithm generates high-resolution images that are competitive or even superior in quality to images produced by other similar SR methods. In addition, the local sparse modeling of our approach is naturally robust to noise, and therefore the proposed algorithm can handle super-resolution with noisy inputs in a more unified framework.},

abstract = {The use of overcomplete dictionaries, or frames, for sparse signal representation has been given considerable attention in recent years. The major challenges are good algorithms for sparse approximations, i.e., vector selection algorithms, and good methods for choosing or designing dictionaries/frames. This work is concerned with the latter. We present a family of iterative least squares based dictionary learning algorithms (ILS-DLA), including algorithms for design of signal dependent block based dictionaries and overlapping dictionaries, as generalizations of transforms and filter banks, respectively. In addition different constraints can be included in the ILS-DLA, thus we present different constrained design algorithms. Experiments show that ILS-DLA is capable of reconstructing (most of) the generating dictionary vectors from a sparsely generated data set, with and without noise. The dictionaries are shown to be useful in applications like signal representation and compression where experiments demonstrate that our ILS-DLA dictionaries substantially improve compression results compared to traditional signal expansions such as transforms and filter banks/wavelets.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in this field has concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. Designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a prespecified set of linear transforms or adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. Both of these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. Given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. We present a new methodâ€”the<tex>\$ K\$</tex>-SVD algorithmâ€”generalizing the<tex>\$ K\$</tex>-means clustering process.<tex>\$ K\$</tex>-SVD is an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based on the current dictionary and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the data.

We analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results both on synthetic tests and in applications on real image data.},

The transforms may include affine deformation and color scaling to account for perspective and tonal variations across the image. The factored representation allows efficient random-access through a simple indirection, and can therefore be used for real-time texture mapping without expansion in memory. Our scheme is orthogonal to traditional image compression, in the sense that the epitome is amenable to further compression such as DXT. Moreover it allows a new mode of progressivity, whereby generic features appear before unique detail. Factoring is also effective across a collection of images, particularly in the context of image-based rendering. Eliminating redundant content lets us include textures that are several times as large in the same memory space.},

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},

abstract = {Sparse signal representation, analysis, and sensing have received a lot of attention in recent years from the signal processing, optimization, and learning communities. On one hand, learning overcomplete dictionaries that facilitate a sparse representation of the data as a liner combination of a few atoms from such dictionary leads to state-of-the-art results in image and video restoration and classification. On the other hand, the framework of compressed sensing (CS) has shown that sparse signals can be recovered from far less samples than those required by the classical Shannon-Nyquist Theorem. The samples used in CS correspond to linear projections obtained by a sensing projection matrix. It has been shown that, for example, a nonadaptive random sampling matrix satisfies the fundamental theoretical requirements of CS, enjoying the additional benefit of universality. On the other hand, a projection sensing matrix that is optimally designed for a certain class of signals can further improve the reconstruction accuracy or further reduce the necessary number of samples. In this paper, we introduce a framework for the joint design and optimization, from a set of training images, of the nonparametric dictionary and the sensing matrix. We show that this joint optimization outperforms both the use of random sensing matrices and those matrices that are optimized independently of the learning of the dictionary. Particular cases of the proposed framework include the optimization of the sensing matrix for a given dictionary as well as the optimization of the dictionary for a predefined sensing environment. The presentation of the framework and its efficient numerical optimization is complemented with numerous examples on classical image datasets.},

abstract = {The title Lasso has been suggested by Tibshirani (1996) as a colourful name for a technique of variable selection which requires the minimization of a sum of squares subject to an l1 bound \{kappa\} on the solution. This forces zero components in the minimizing solution for small values of \{kappa\}. Thus this bound can function as a selection parameter. This paper makes two contributions to computational problems associated with implementing the Lasso: (1) a compact descent method for solving the constrained problem for a particular value of \{kappa\} is formulated, and (2) a homotopy method, in which the constraint bound \{kappa\} becomes the homotopy parameter, is developed to completely describe the possible selection regimes. Both algorithms have a finite termination property. It is suggested that modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization applied to an augmented design matrix provides an effective basis for implementing the algorithms. 10.1093/imanum/20.3.389},

In this paper, we present efficient sparse coding algorithms that are based on iteratively solving two convex optimization problems: an L1-regularized least squares problem and an L2-constrained least squares problem. We propose novel algorithms to solve both of these optimization problems. Our algorithms result in a significant speedup for sparse coding, allowing us to learn larger sparse codes than possible with previously described algorithms. We apply these algorithms to natural images and demonstrate that the inferred sparse codes exhibit end-stopping and non-classical receptive field surround suppression and, therefore, may provide a partial explanation for these two phenomena in V1 neurons. 1},

As such, the choice of the dictionary that sparsifies the signals is crucial for the success of this model. In general, the choice of a proper dictionary can be done using one of two ways: i) building a sparsifying dictionary based on a mathematical model of the data, or ii) learning a dictionary to perform best on a training set. In this paper we describe the evolution of these two paradigms. As manifestations of the first approach, we cover topics such as wavelets, wavelet packets, contourlets, and curvelets, all aiming to exploit 1-D and 2-D mathematical models for constructing effective dictionaries for signals and images. Dictionary learning takes a different route, attaching the dictionary to a set of examples it is supposed to serve. From the seminal work of Field and Olshausen, through the MOD, the K-SVD, the Generalized PCA and others, this paper surveys the various options such training has to offer, up to the most recent contributions and structures.},

abstract = {Sparse coding consists in representing signals as sparse linear combinations of atoms selected from a dictionary. We consider an extension of this framework where the atoms are further assumed to be embedded in a tree. This is achieved using a recently introduced tree-structured sparse regularization norm, which has proven useful in several applications. This norm leads to regularized problems that are difficult to optimize, and we propose in this paper efficient algorithms for solving them. More precisely, we show that the proximal operator associated with this norm is computable exactly via a dual approach that can be viewed as the composition of elementary proximal operators. Our procedure has a complexity linear, or close to linear, in the number of atoms, and allows the use of accelerated gradient techniques to solve the tree-structured sparse approximation problem at the same computational cost as traditional ones using the L1-norm. Our method is efficient and scales gracefully to millions of variables, which we illustrate in two types of applications: first, we consider fixed hierarchical dictionaries of wavelets to denoise natural images. Then, we apply our optimization tools in the context of dictionary learning, where learned dictionary elements naturally organize in a prespecified arborescent structure, leading to a better performance in reconstruction of natural image patches. When applied to text documents, our method learns hierarchies of topics, thus providing a competitive alternative to probabilistic topic models.},

abstract = {Algorithms for data-driven learning of domain-specific overcomplete dictionaries are developed to obtain maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori dictionary estimates based on the use of Bayesian models with concave/Schur-concave (CSC) negative log priors. Such priors are appropriate for obtaining sparse representations of environmental signals within an appropriately chosen (environmentally matched) dictionary. The elements of the dictionary can be interpreted as concepts, features, or words capable of succinct expression of events encountered in the environment (the source of the measured signals). This is a generalization of vector quantization in that one is interested in a description involving a few dictionary entries (the proverbial "25 words or less"), but not necessarily as succinct as one entry. To learn an environmentally adapted dictionary capable of concise expression of signals generated by the environment, we develop algorithms that iterate between a representative set of sparse representations found by variants of FOCUSS and an update of the dictionary using these sparse representations.Experiments were performed using synthetic data and natural images. For complete dictionaries, we demonstrate that our algorithms have improved performance over other independent component analysis (ICA) methods, measured in terms of signal-to-noise ratios of separated sources. In the overcomplete case, we show that the true underlying dictionary and sparse sources can be accurately recovered. In tests with natural images, learned overcomplete dictionaries are shown to have higher coding efficiency than complete dictionaries; that is, images encoded with an overcomplete dictionary have both higher compression (fewer bits per pixel) and higher accuracy (lower mean square error).},

Two training options are considered: using the corrupted image itself, or training on a corpus of high-quality image database.

Coupled with the ability to train the dictionary using signal examples, these techniques have been shown to lead to state-of-the-art results in a series of recent applications. In this paper we propose a novel structure of such a model for representing image content. The new dictionary is itself a small image, such that every patch in it (in varying location and size) is a possible atom in the representation. We refer to this as the Image-Signature-Dictionary (ISD), and show how it can be trained from image examples. This novel structure enjoys several important features, such as shift and scale flexibilities, and smaller memory and computational requirements, compared to the classical dictionary approach. As a demonstration of these benefits, we present high-quality image denoising results based on this new model.},

The low-resolution image is viewed as downsampled version of a high-resolution image, whose patches are assumed to have a sparse representation with respect to an over-complete dictionary of prototype signal-atoms. The principle of compressed sensing ensures that under mild conditions, the sparse representation can be correctly recovered from the downsampled signal. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of sparsity as a prior for regularizing the otherwise ill-posed super-resolution problem. We further show that a small set of randomly chosen raw patches from training images of similar statistical nature to the input image generally serve as a good dictionary, in the sense that the computed representation is sparse and the recovered high-resolution image is competitive or even superior in quality to images produced by other SR methods.},

abstract = {The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets, Forward Selection, and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on the basis of the same set of data to which the model will be applied. Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived. (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of Ordinary Least Squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as Ordinary Least Squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

abstract = {Bag-of-words document representations are often used in text, image and video processing. While it is relatively easy to determine a suitable word dictionary for text documents, there is no simple mapping from raw images or videos to dictionary terms. The classical approach builds a dictionary using vector quantization over a large set of useful visual descriptors extracted from a training set, and uses a nearest-neighbor algorithm to count the number of occurrences of each dictionary word in documents to be encoded. More robust approaches have been proposed recently that represent each visual descriptor as a sparse weighted combination of dictionary words. While favoring a sparse representation at the level of visual descriptors, those methods however do not ensure that images have sparse representation. In this work, we use mixed-norm regularization to achieve sparsity at the image level as well as a small overall dictionary. This approach can also be used to encourage using the same dictionary words for all the images in a class, providing a discriminative signal in the construction of image on a benchmark image classification dataset show that when compact image or dictionary representations are needed for computational efficiency, the proposed approach yields better mean average precision in classification.},

 its epitome and a smooth mapping from the epitome to the image
 pixels. When the epitomic representation is used within a
 hierarchical generative model, appropriate inference algorithms can
 be derived to extract the epitome from a single image or a

 tasks, such as image segmentation, motion estimation, object

On the other hand, explicitly exploiting the self-similarities of natural images has led to the successful non-local means approach to image restoration. We propose simultaneous sparse coding as a framework for combining these two approaches in a natural manner. This is achieved by jointly decomposing groups of similar signals on subsets of the learned dictionary. Experimental results in image denoising and demosaicking tasks with synthetic and real noise show that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art, making it possible to effectively restore raw images from digital cameras at a reasonable speed and memory cost.},

Suppose we seek the sparsest solution, i.e., the one with the fewest nonzero entries: can it ever be unique? If so, when? As optimization of sparsity is combinatorial in nature, are there efficient methods for finding the sparsest solution? These questions have been answered positively and constructively in recent years, exposing a wide variety of surprising phenomena; in particular, the existence of easily-verifiable conditions under which optimally-sparse solutions can be found by concrete, effective computational methods. Such theoretical results inspire a bold perspective on some important practical problems in signal and image processing. Several well-known signal and image processing problems can be cast as demanding solutions of undetermined systems of equations. Such problems have previously seemed, to many, intractable. There is considerable evidence that these problems often have sparse solutions. Hence, advances in finding sparse solutions to underdetermined systems energizes research on such signal and image processing problems â€“ to striking effect.

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone.

For signals such as natural images that admit such sparse representations, it is now well established that these models are well suited to restoration tasks. In this context, learning the dictionary amounts to solving a large-scale matrix factorization problem, which can be done efficiently with classical optimization tools. The same approach has also been used for learning features from data for other purposes, e.g., image classification, but tuning the dictionary in a supervised way for these tasks has proven to be more difficult. In this paper, we present a general formulation for supervised dictionary learning adapted to a wide variety of tasks, and present an efficient algorithm for solving the corresponding optimization problem. Experiments on handwritten digit classification, digital art identification, nonlinear inverse image problems, and compressed sensing demonstrate that our approach is effective in large-scale settings, and is well suited to supervised and semi-supervised classification, as well as regression tasks for data that admit sparse representations.},
