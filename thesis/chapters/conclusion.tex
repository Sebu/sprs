\section{Discussion}

Compression 
JPEG and JPEG 2000 are highly optimized lossy image compression algorithms. 
Years of research went into observation human vision and the 
Especialy the quantization and and the entropy encoding step are highly
omptimized for the ... data.
For the short time available our results show promissig results in visual
quality but still lack ...
But it is hard to compete with the market leader in this field.  Even JPEG 2000,
which leads to better results than JPEG escpacialy in the area block artifacs,
did not catch up with the sucess of JPEG. 
The reason propably lies in the potetial patent issues and higher computational
requirements of the algorithm compared
to the quality benefits. And the wide accpetance of JPEG in ...

Dicts to universal ... improved results to dct .. but varying with field of
application. possible no universal solution but a good way for better
understanding of the key elements 

Future dictionaries
First moving away from structure induced by basis transform in analytical
dictionaries ... now realizing and moving back to structure ... promissing
results\cite{?,?,?}



\subsection*{Limitations}
Convergence of the dictionary lerning step.

OMP:
  start looks like DCT (random init)
  noisy
  only pratical for OMP

LARS-lasso:
  slow 
  high quality dictionary

  Most common atoms in the dictionary 
  4? types of elements
  gradient, checkerboard (low color more b/w), spot, edge

\section{Future work}
The amount of publications regarding in
the last decade indicate strong ongoing research in this field sparse coding and
dictionarie learning. Espacialy brining structure to the learning stage is one
of the most active topics in this fields/area of research.
