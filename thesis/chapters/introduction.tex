\section{Learning dictionaries}

%Learning the most significant basis elements, that make up an
%signal, is a popular task in signal processing.

Data networks, data transfer, error correction. For example experiments by
\cite{} have shown that just the right basis directly learned from images can
yield much better results in reconstruction than those based on mathematical
functions such as cosine transforms or wavelet\cite{Elad2006,Mairal2010}
transforms. These learned basis elements can lead to better reconstruction
quality of images in large image databases and assist tasks such as
classification, noise removal, image enhancement, organization and compression.

For 
Can large databases benefit from that? Can we effectivly learn dictionaries for
large databases? What else can we learn from these dictionaries?



Learning such basis is often limited to small training sets of 100.000s. Large
database have training sets of millions and more.
In 2009 Mairal et al.\cite{Mairal2009} presented an new online learning
algorithm that can consume  rather than just a fixed batch. 

As an application example we will show compression. We evaluation sparse coding
and basis learning algorithms and strategies for large image databases and
transport recent discoveries in sparse coding and basis learning into a real
world example of image compression.

\section{Structure of thesis}
The next chapter gives an overview on the idea of sparse signal
representation with a short excurs into the history of signal analysis.
Chapter three describes the fundamental theory of sparse coding, introduces the
most common algorithms and presents usual applications of sparse coding. The
fourth chapter introduces algorithms for the design of over-complete
dictionaries of basis elements and presents current related work in this field.
The fifth chapter describes the applied methods for sparse
coding, the generation of dictionaries via clustered training with a large image
database of 1,000,000 images collected from \url{flickr.com}. Presents
experiments regarding the structure of dictionary elements, convergence of the
training process, comparison of signal representation quality and adaptability
of sparse coding for image compression. The two final chapters present the
results of the experiments, discuss these results and new findings and show
potential improvements in future work.
