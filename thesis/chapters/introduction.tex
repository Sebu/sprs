\section{Learning dictionaries}

Finding the most significant basis elements, that make up a
signal, is a popular task in signal processing. A sparse selection of such
elements coded in the right way can assist in imaging tasks such as noise
removal, image enhancement, classification or compression. This selection
process is also known as sparse coding.

Experiments \cite{Chen1998,Elad2006} have shown that dictionaries of 
elements directly learned from images can yield much better results in
such sparse coding tasks than those designed from mathematical functions like
sinusoids or wavelets. But most of the current learning algorithms are limited
to small batches of about 100.000 training samples. Learning from
larger sets of millions of samples found in large images databases is a
challenge. In 2009 Mairal et al.\cite{Mairal2009} presented a new online
learning algorithm that can constantly consume new samples rather than just a
fixed batch. 

We want to investigate this algorithm on how to learn dictionaries
for large image databases and effectively code the elements. As an example
application to use the learned dictionaries we develop a sparse coding
compression algorithm and compare the performance to other compression
algorithms.

\section{Structure of this thesis}
The next chapter gives an overview on the idea of sparse signal
representation with a short excursus into the history of signal analysis.
Chapter three describes the fundamental theory of sparse coding, introduces the
most common algorithms and presents usual applications of sparse coding. The
fourth chapter introduces algorithms for learning over-complete
dictionaries of basis elements and presents current related work in this field.
The fifth chapter describes the framework for sparse coding, generation
of dictionaries and design decisions. Chapter six presents and discusses
experiments regarding convergence of the training process, the structure of
dictionary elements and adaptability of sparse coding for image compression. 
The final chapter draws conclusions from the experiments and shows potential
improvements in future work.
