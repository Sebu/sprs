Images can be decomposed into a sparse linear combination of basis
elements. This process is known as sparse coding. Learning dictionaries of
those basis elements rather than designing them can lead to quality improvements
of operations on images. Such as noise removal, classification or compression.
In the last decade several algorithms for learning such basis elements were
proposed.

This thesis develops a framework that uses a new online learning
algorithms to learn big dictionaries that can be used for large image databases
in tasks such as reconstruction and compression. One challenge is to overcome
speed and convergence limitation of the learning algorithm. To address these
issues a clustering approach is applied. 

For evaluation, the framework is then used to learn big dictionaries from a
large sets of images. The learned dictionaries are used in a new dictionary
based compression algorithm that yields similar quality as JPEG.
%#. can surpass it.
