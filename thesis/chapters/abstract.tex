Caputering the esential structure of images is a major task in signal
processing. and allows us to capture the most significant basis elements that
make up a signal. These dictionaries can support to speed up and improve quality
of operations on images. Like transformation, classification or compression
The learned elements are investigated.

This thesis develops a framework that helps to learn big dictionaries
from large sets of data and proposes a real world sparse coding compression
algorithm useable with the learned dictionaries. [benefit of large database] One
challenge is to overcome speed and convergence limitation of the learning
algorithm. To address this issue a clustering approach is applied. 

For testing, the framework is then used to learn big dictionaries from a large
set of images. The learned dictionaries are then tested on reconstruction
tasks on images from the large image database and the compression algorihm is
compared to JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression strategies.
