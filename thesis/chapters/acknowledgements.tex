I thank Professor Marc Alexa for making this all possible, my disney internship
and for examining this thesis. I would also like to thank Professor Olaf
Hellwich for co-examining this work. 

Thanks goes also to Mathias Eitz for his supervision and helpful tips
throughout this thesis. And to my family for the good food, motivation and
childhood. 
My best buds Philipp and Sebastian for their mental support.
And especially Sebastian for his excessive last minute proof-reading.
